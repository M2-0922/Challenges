### Steps to create a hollow pyramid star pattern are:

- Run 2 nested loops, 1st for 'n' times and there are 2 internal loops one to print the first series of spaces and the other to print star and space series
- Print star for first and last position in each row and space in between
- The print star at each position in the last row
